# System-Analysis-and-Design
DriverPass is the client, with Liam as the owner and Ian as his IT. They wanted me to design a website (preferably cloud) that provides online driving practice tests and the ability to book on-road driving sessions.

I think I designed the entire system meeting all of the clients needs and created UML diagrams to accurately display these requirements.

If I had to revise one aspect of my project it would be my Gantt chart. I do not find it visually appealing therefore I would like to organize the milestones by months instead of individual days.

I made sure to throughly read through the DriverPass transcript to ensure I understood all of the clients requests. It is crucial to consider the user's needs when designing an application because their perspective differs from a developers and this will ensure the projet is successful and fulfills all of the clients requirements.

I use the top down approach for designing software. I look at the entire project as a whole and break it down into subclasses that can be treated as its own system and broken down even further. I ike this approach best and will continue using it in the future.
